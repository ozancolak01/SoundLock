# SoundLock
SoundLock is a system that uses sound to add an extra layer of security when logging into accounts. It works by listening to the background noise from both the user's trusted phone and the new device trying to log in. If the sounds match, access is granted. This helps prevent unauthorized access while also making logging in easier for users.
